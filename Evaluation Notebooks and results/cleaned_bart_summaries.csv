what's going on everyone in this video we will learn what is logistic regression where it is used and with the simple example we will try to understand how to apply logistic regression so let's get started I am Jay Patel and I upload new videos on machine learning every week so make sure to hit the red subscribe button and also hit the Bell icon and for now let's jump to this board logistic regression is a machine learning model which is used for the binary classificationwhat is binary classification binary classification is where our output predictions can only take one of the two possible values for example it can be either 0 or 1 or it can be either true or false was some of the applications where the logistic regression can be used in real world can be to classify the email is a spam or not where to find out if the transaction is fraud or notor it can be also to find out if the person having a disease or not or to find out if the tumor is a malignant or not so you can see that logistic regression is used when our output prediction can take either of the values means either this value or that value know this can be very well understood with the help of this example let's say our goal is to predict if the person is having a heart disease or not based on our input feature whichthis age for Simplicity I have taken a very simple dataset where we are only considering only one input feature that is the age of the person so now how can you make new predictions based on this given data set one thing we can do is draw an approximate straight line that fits this data set and we can consider that straight line as the probability if the person is having a heart disease or not what do I mean by that let me show you now based on thisthen what we can do is we can predict if the person is having heart disease or not for a new input features or less if you want to find if the person having this age has a heart disease or not then what we can do is we can go to this line and see what is the value of this so This value will serve as the probability for us so this is this much is the probability that the person is having a heart disease and if this probably is about 0.5 then we will classifywhat is the probability is below 0.5 we will classify it as 0 but this approach actually has one flower you can see that the straight line cannot actually fit properly to the status of you will see a lot of gaps here here here here here here here here here here also let's see if you want to predict if the person having this age has a heart disease or not then this method will give us actually the wrong way because it is classifying zero sogo to overcome this one thing we can do is to draw a car that actually fits appropriately to this data set like this kind of car so you can see that this curve actually fits more appropriately to the data set and it is also more likely to give us the right predictions but how do we draw this car so this girl is actually called as a sigmoid curvein sigmoid curve look something like this so sigmoid curves takes the 0.5 as the value when our ex is 0 and whenever X is very large it takes roughly one as the value not exactly one but like 0.999 or so and then the axe is very low it takes almost close to zero as the value and the formula for Discordis 1/11 + - x now what we can do is we can take the traditional straight line that we draw with this formula y equal to mx + C the straight line that we dropped before and apply this straight line a sigmoid curve so we will just apply sigmoid of why which will be sigmoid of MX + C and we will get this car and that's how we plot occur that fits bestnow this was only for one of the input feature let's see if our data set is a number of features than our equation of the straight line can be given by now here W's are the parameters which can also be called as weights and eggs are our features our input features now we just have to apply sigmoid over this equation and we can make predictions for any data setwith any number of features we can also represent this equation in the form of Matrix as y equals to W transpose x + B now this W represent the Matrix of all these W's and it is of the shape and comma one in other words we can pass this input feature Vector with our weights and B to get so ex will bepresented in the form of Matrix of all the input features which will be multiplied with W transport and submission with B to get our troubles x + B now this will then pass to our sigmoid curve which will give our final predictions and this final predicting value represent the probability of the person having a heart disease or not so if this probability is greater than 0.5 then we will classify it asone means the person has a heart disease if this probability is less than 0.5 then we will cross it buy it as 0 so that was about logistic regression now we need to train this input weight or the parameters so that our curve best fits to our given dataset and whenever Curve will fit best to ever given data set then we can make accurate predictions to do that we need to use something called cost function now clickon this video where we will understand what is cost function for logistic regression so I see you there,"logistic regression is a machine learning model which is used for the binary classification. binary classification is where our output predictions can only take one of the two possible values. logistic regression can be used in real world to classify the email is Simplicity is an open-source, free-to-use computer program. It can be used to predict if a person is having a heart disease or not based on their age. The program can also predict if the person is Let's see if you want to predict if the person having this age has a heart disease or not then this method will give us actually the wrong way because it is classifying zero sogo. To overcome this one thing we can do The formula for Discordis 1/11 + - x is y equal to mx + C. 0.5 as the value when our ex is 0 and whenever X is very large it takes roughly one as thevalue not exactly Matrix as y equals to W transpose x + B now this W represent the Matrix of all these W's and it is of the shape and comma one in other words we can pass this input feature Vector with our weights and B to We will understand what is cost function for logistic regression so I see you there. function now clickon this video where we will understand how logistic regressions work. function for Logistic Regression. function.

the basic function underlying a normal distribution AKA a gaussian is e to the negative x squared but you might wonder why this function of all the Expressions we could dream up that give you some symmetric smooth graph with mass concentrated towards the middle why is it that the theory of probability seems to have a special place in its heart for this particular expression for the last many videos I've been hinting at an answer to this question and here we'll finally arrive at something like a satisfying answer as a quick refresher around where we areShuffle videos ago we talked about the central limit theorem which describes how as you add multiple copies of a random variable for example rolling a weighted die many different times or letting a ball bounce off of a peg repeatedly then the distribution describing that sum tends to look approximately like a normal distribution what the central limit theorem says is that you make that some bigger and bigger under appropriate conditions that approximation to a normal becomes better and better but I never explained why this theorem is actuallywe only talked about what it's claiming in the last video we started talking about the math involved in adding to random variables if you have two random variables each following some distribution then to find the distribution describing the sum of those variables you compute something known as a convolution between the two original functions and we spent a lot of time building up two distinct ways to visualize what this convolution operation really is today are basic job is to work through a particular example whichwhat happens when you add to normally distributed random variables which as you know by now is the same as asking what do you get if you compute a convolution between two gaussian functions I'd like to share and especially pleasing visual way that you can think about this calculation which hopefully offers some sense of what makes the e to the negative x squared function special in the first place after we walk through it we'll talk about how this calculation is one of the steps involved in proving the central limit theorem it's the step that answers the questionorigin of why a gaussian and not something else is the central limit but first let's dive in the full formula for a gaussian is more complicated than just e to the negative x squared the exponent is typically written as -1/2 * x / Sigma squared where Sigma describes the spread of the distribution specifically the standard deviation all of this needs to be multiplied by a fraction on the front which is there to make sure that the areaplay The Curve is one making it a valid probability distribution and if you want to consider distributions that aren't necessarily centered at 0 you would also throw another parameter moo into the exponent like this although for everything will be doing here we just considered distributions now if you look at our Central goal for today which is to compute a convolution between two gaussian functions the direct way to do this would be to take the definition of a convolution this integral expression we build up last video and then to plugagain for each one of the functions involved the formula for a gaussian is kind of a lot of symbols when you throw it all together but more than anything working this out is an exercise in completing the square and there's nothing wrong with that that will get you the answer that you want but of course you know me I'm a sucker for visual intuition and in this case there's another way to think about it that I haven't seen written about before that offers a very nice connection to other aspects of this distribution like the presence of p in certain ways to derive where it comes from and the way I'd like to do this is by firstfeeling away all of the constants associated with the actual distribution and just showing the computation for the simplified form e to the negative x squared the essence of what we want to compute is what the convolution between two copies of this function looks like if you'll remember in the last video we had two different ways to visualize convolutions and the one will be using here is the second one involving diagonal slices and is a quick reminder of the way that worked if you have two different distributions that are described by two different functionsis f&g then every possible pair of values that you might get when you sample from these two distributions can be thought of as individual points on the XY plane and the probability density of landing on one such Point assuming Independence looks like f of x * G of why so what we do is we look at a graph of that expression as a two variable function of X and Y which is a way of showing the distribution of all possible outcomes when we sample from the two different variablesto interpret the convolution of Effigy evaluated on some input s which is a way of saying How likely are you to get a pair of samples that adds up to this sum es what you do is you look at a slice of this graph over the line X Plus y equals s and you consider the area under that slice this area is almost but not quite the value of the convolution at SS for a mildly technical reason you need to divided by the square root ofyou still this area is the key feature to focus on you can think of it as a way to combine together all the probability densities for all of the outcomes corresponding to a given sum in the specific case were these two functions look like e to the negative x squared and e to the negative y squared the resulting 3D graph has a really nice property that you can exploit its rotationally symmetric you can see this by combining the terms and noticingit's entirely a function of x ^ 2 + y squared and this term describes the square of the distance between any point on the XY plane and the origin so in other words the expression is purely a function of the distance from the origin and by the way this would not be true for any other distribution it's a property that uniquely characterizes bell curves so for most other pairs of functions these diagonal slices will be some complicated shape that's hard to think about and honestlycalculating the area would just amount to Computing the original integral that defines a convolution in the first place so in most cases the visual intuition doesn't really buy you anything but in the case of bell curves you can leverage that rotational symmetry here focus on one of these slices over the line X Plus y equals s for some value of s and remember the convolution that we're trying to compute is a function of s the thing that you want is an expression of s that tells you the areaunder the slice well if you look at that line it intersects the x-axis at 0 and the y-axis at 0s and a little bit of Pythagoras will show you that the straight-line distance from the origin to this line is soooo divided by the square root of 2 now because of the Symmetry the slice is identical to one that you get rotating 45 degrees or you'd find something parallel to the y-axis the same distance away from the origin the key is that Computing this other areaa slice parallel to the y-axis is much much easier than slices in other directions because it only involves taking an integral with respect to why the value of x on the slice is a constant specifically it would be the constant s divided by the square root of 2 so when you're Computing the integral finding this area all of this term here behaves like it was just some number and you can Factor it out this is the important Point all of the stuff that's involving es is now entirely separate from the integratedthis remaining integral is a little bit tricky I did a whole video on it it's actually quite famous but you almost don't really care the point is that it's just some number that number happens to be the square root of Pi but what really matters is that it's something with no dependents on S and essentially this is our answer we were looking for an expression for the area of these slices as a function of s and now we have it it looks like e to the negative squared divided by 2 scale by some constant in other wordsit's also a bell curve another gaussian just stretched out a little bit because of this too in the exponent as I said earlier the convolution evaluated at es is not quite this area technically it's this area divided by the square root of 2 we talked about it in the last video but it doesn't really matter because it just gets baked into the constant what really matters is the conclusion that a convolution between two gaussians is itself another gaussian if you were to go back and reintroduce all of theConstance for a normal distribution with a mean zero and an arbitrary standard deviation Sigma essentially identical reasoning will lead to the same square root of 2 factor that shows up in the exponent and out front and it leads to the conclusion that the convolution between two such normal distributions is another normal distribution with a standard deviation square root of 2 * Sigma if you haven't computed a lot of convolutions before it's worth emphasizing this is a very special result almost always you end up with a completely different kind of functionbut here there's a sort of stability to the process also for those of you who enjoy exercises I'll leave one up on the screen for how you would handle the case of two different standard deviations still some of you might be raising your hands and saying what's the big deal I mean when you first heard the question what do you get when you add to normally distributed random variables you probably even guessed that the answer should be another normally distributed variable after all what else is it going to be normal distributions are supposedly quite common sonot you could even say that this should follow from the central limit theorem but that would have it all backwards first of all the supposed ubiquity of normal distributions is often a little exaggerated but to the extent that they do come up it is because of the central limit theorem but it would be cheating to say the central limit theorem implies this result because this computation we just did is the reason that the function at the heart of the central limit theorem is a gaussian in the first place and not some other function we've talked all about the central limit theoremif you repeatedly add copies of a random variable to itself which mathematically looks like repeatedly Computing convolutions against a given distribution then after appropriate shifting and rescaling the tendency is always to approach a normal distribution technically there's a small assumption the distribution you start with can't have infinite variants but it's a relatively soft assumption the magic is that for a huge category of initial distributions this process of adding a whole bunch of random variablewho's John from that distribution always tends towards this one universal shape a gaussian one common approach to proving this theorem involves two separate steps the first step is to show that for all the different finite variants distributions you might start with there exists a single Universal shape that this process of repeated convolutions tends towards this step is actually pretty technical it goes a little beyond what I want to talk about here you often use these objects called moment generating functions that gives you a very abstract argument that there mustbe some Universal shape but it doesn't make any Claim about what that particular shape is just that everything in this big family is tending towards a single point in the space of distributions so then step number two is what we just showed in this video proved that the convolution of two gaussians gives another gaussian what that means is that as you apply this process of repeated convolutions a gaussian doesn't change its a fixed point so the only thing it can approach is itself and since it's one member in this big family of distributionsall of which must be tending towards a single Universal shape it must be that Universal shape I mentioned at the start how this calculation Step 2 is something that you can do directly just symbolically with the definitions but one of the reasons I'm so Charmed by a geometric argument that leverages the rotational symmetry of this graph is it directly connected to a few things that we've talked about on this channel before for example the Herschel Maxwell derivation of a gaussian which essentially says that you can view this rotational symmetry asdefining feature of the distribution that it locks you into this e to the negative x squared form and also as an added bonus it connects to the classic proof for why P shows up in the formula meaning we now have a direct line between the presence and mystery of that pie and the central limit theorem also on a recent patreon post the channel supporter Doctrine Quinter brought my attention to a completely different approach I hadn't seen before which leverages the use of entropy and again for the theoretically curious among you I'll leave some links in the descriptionby the way if you want to stay up to date with new videos and also any other projects that I put out there like the summer of math Exposition there is a mailing list It's relatively new and I'm pretty sparing about only posting what I think people will enjoy usually I try not to be too promotional at the end of videos these days but if you are interested in following the work that I do this is probably one of the most enduring ways to do so,Shuffle videos ago we talked about the central limit

"when you ask the large language model a question it is important that it retrieves the most relevant information to answer it this is otherwise known as retrieval augmented generation for example when you asked Tracy PT what the name of your dog is it has no clue but if you feed it the data that is in stored in your vector database and maybe you specify that Erica has a dog and her name is Bowen is able to retrieve that relevant contacts and properly answer yourto ensure that the language model is one receiving the most relevant information maybe instead of feeding it the whole PDF document you feed it by Elements which I have a visual for and then two you don't want to go over the context window and this is dependent on which model that you are using starting with the text splitter so what this does is it takes the PDF document which we have here on the left hand sidetasty chunks depending on the model or the trunk size that you define so for example GPT 3.5 turbo 16k has a 16,000 token window but other models have either a smaller or larger window size so just what this is doing is just splitting up the text once it hits the limit and then boom we have chunk one which is the blue text and then it moves right on to the green window which is the next turnthe rolling window compliments the text splitter extremely well and this is because once trunk one is finished chunked to will begin with a few tokens or characters that is included in trunk 1 so in this example you can see the blue text from this document is the beginning or the start of Chunk 2 and this is very important in documents where the second sentence doesn't make sense because it doesn't have the information fromthey all three have this implemented in their Frameworks and at the end of this video I'll share it with you with the link to the documentation so you can test this out for yourself moving on to how you would chunk PDF documents so previously should green I partnered up on creating a demo for unstructured so what we did was we ingested PDF documents which were two research papers and then we chunked it by the elements which unstructured hasbefore I highly recommend checking it out along with llama index so what it is doing is it takes the PDF heading so in this example I have the abstract introduction and related work so each section will have its own chunk and this is very important when making queries that are specific to titles so this is that kind of semantic region of searching and maybe you'd have like the abstract property introduction property etceterawhat is one way to make sure that you have extremely relevant information if you're interested in using unstructured with llama index of so if you start typing in on structured you can find the file loader here and this is where you can ingest txt files dark PowerPoint jpeg all of it then moving on to the Llama index note parser so this is where you would Define that trunk size that I talked about and then also the trunk overlap so what this truck overlap of 20 tokensinto the following trunk and this is the leg chain documentation on where they have their text letters so they have I believe code on how to do this and maybe if you want to split the text by the new lines or also the trunk overlap and the trunk size as well and then ending with Haystack they have the trunk size and then again the split overlap so you can check that outand then I want to end this video with recommending you join the arise Workshop that I will be hosting along with a man from arise and Ronnie from unstructured we will be exploring the trunking techniques and re-ranking for enhancing your retrieval and the results in your back application I hope you guys are able to join and I'll see you next time bye",When you ask the large language model a question it is important that it retrieves the most relevant information to answer it this is otherwise known as retrieval augmented generation.

hey John good evening we've got a lot of updates for you here in this developing story will start with a new directive from Israel's Homefront command this is the organization linked to the military responsible for communicating to civilians here they are telling civilians in the Golan Heights also in Israel's Southernmost city of a lot and in some smaller cities and towns close to the desert to stay near bomb shelters an indication that Israeli officialsleave this initial wave of drones is going to Target the northern and southern parts of this country we also at this hour are reporting on a new statement from Iran's permanent mission to the UN there was a post put out on X and as we speak here you can actually hear an Israeli jet going overhead but there was a post put out on X by the Iranian government through their permanent mission to the UN that post redif they have conducted the matter saying it could be deemed concluded and indication that Iran wants to try and contain their response to the Israeli strike earlier this month on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus Syria that killed seven members of Iran's irgc the question now is whether or not the Israeli government and Military will accept this event as over remember these drones have not yet reached Israeli airspace we don't know the true extent of the attack yetthere is no indication at this hour despite reports in Iranian media that the Iranians have fired ballistic missiles there are some other reports that indicate cruise missiles could be part of this attack once Israel determines just how broad of an attack this is the war cabinet that is still meeting at this hour in Tel Aviv at the carry out Israel's version of the Pentagon will ultimately launched their response we do understand their will be in Israeli response to this attack against their territory the question islook like and what type of coordination is currently being conducted with the American forces that are operating right now out of the Middle East John these reports that Iran fired ballistic missiles those are coming from Iranian media and so far there's no absolute confirmation of that because that would be a game-changer here absolutely it would be a game changer and it's important to note Israel does have the air defense capabilitiesto shoot down such missiles there are a variety of missiles the Iranians have in their Arsenal the shahab ballistic missile would likely be what they would use in a situation like this the range covers all of Israel but Israel has an advanced missile defense system called The Arrow to and also they have a later version of this system called The Arrow 3 now these systems have been tested they are extremely efficient and they have the ability to shoot down these advancedballistic missiles this system would be used by the Israelis if the Iranians ratchet up their attack and if that does take place as you've noted it would be another step up on an escalation ladder that is already being climbed by both the Israelis and the Iranians this month as we noted the Israelis targeted these Iranian Generals in Siri go ahead John well I just wanted to do interrupt you for just a second tray and I apologize because you're doing terrific work under difficult circumstances but the video you're seeing onturn your screen right now is footage taken from Iraq of the Iranian drones actually flying over Iraqi territory presumably on their way to Israel you can see that the the flame column coming out of these things is pretty significant they throw off a lot of heat and it's fairly easy for the interceptors to pick up on that heat signature and bring down these drones so it ishopes that no money no matter how many dozens of them have been launched perhaps 100 perhaps more than 100 that most of them are going to get shot down by some of those Israeli systems that you talked about again that footage from Iraq after Iran for the first time ever launched a series of strikes launching dozens maybe hundreds of cruise missiles to fly over a rocky territory and on to Israel all right let's get back toare you in Tel Aviv sorry to interrupt and I'm looking at this video here and we should note two things there are reports that indicate cruise missiles could be involved in this attack and the second thing of note here when we look at video coming out of a rock is the fact that Iran has control over these shoes that operate across Iraq they have been used in the past to Target American BASis in the Middle East and the real concern is that these proxy forces will not only be involved in this initial response toward Israel but could be involved in any sort of escalating conflict that unfolds as a result of the Iranian attack attack tonight toward the Jewish State there is a concern from the Israelis that they could be overwhelmed with the amount of drones and possibly cruise missiles that are used in this initial Iranian attack and it's part of the reasonyou've seen such close coordination with their allies including the Americans to shoot down some of these projectiles being launched from Iranian territory and possibly a rocky territory there are initial reports coming in and I'm just getting this from my producer right now according to two US officials the US military shot down at least one Iranian drone that was headed toward Israel now they would have shot down this drone with fighter jets that are currently operating in the Middle Eastyou also understand according to our defense sources here in Israel the Israelis have had jets in the sky all night even before this attack started in anticipation of the attack and remember earlier this evening on the phone Israel's defense minister of Galant spoke with his American counterpart defense secretary Lloyd Austin there has been a close coordination between the Americans and the Israelis anticipating this this attack would take place the intelligence was correct and when we talkedwhat about the war that's unfolded over the past 6 months in Israel there's been a lot of criticism about Israeli intelligence and the American intelligence provided to the Israelis that they miss things when it comes to the attacks from Hamas and Islamic Jihad they were spot-on with this the anticipation was high it's part of the reason the Israeli Society did not have runs on banks or grocery stores at a large extent right now things are calm and Israel's major population centers including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and while there are these instructions frompause Homefront command for civilians living in the northern and southern most parts of this country they are very simple instructions they are asking civilians to stay close to bomb shelters at this our understanding that if these drones slip past the fighter jets and the air defense systems that could Target civilian population centers but no one is panicking at this moment and there are Israeli officials as we speak that are trying to determine what the Israeli response will be to this unprecedented eventhey Sean Hannity here hey click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews

video like that motivates me to create more content for you thank you very much let's get straight into the tutorial so to teach you how to prepare for your interview in under 10 minutes I will cover the following three things number one I will give you three quick but crucial tips that will help you to impress the hiring manager at your job interviewnumber two I will then give you eight brilliant words to use in your interview when describing yourself now these eight words will resonate positively with the hiring manager and they will help you to beat the competition and then finally number three I will give you three brilliant questions to ask at the end of your job interview that will significantly boost your chances of success do not make the mistake of not asking questions at the endwhat is your interview because asking the right questions is a clever way to getting hired to begin with let me give you three quick but crucial tips to help you impress the hiring manager please take notes tip number one make sure you dress smart for your interview now if you turn up in a small outfit such as a suit it tells the interviewer two things number one you have high standards and number two you care about the job you are applying for ifyou don't make an effort in your appearance it sends the wrong message to the hiring manager please dress smart for your job interview because it will make a big difference I promise tip number two make sure you spend several minutes quickly researching the company before you attend your interview so immediately after I have finished this training tutorial go to the company's website and have a look at the following two things number one have a look at their websitetake note of what they actually do and look into their history because this will enable you to answer the interview question what can you tell us about our company and number two then have a quick look online at their products and services what services do they offer or which products do they sell so when they ask you in the interview why do you want to work for us you can respond by saying this I have looked at your products and servicesdid everything you do is carried out to a very high standard I too have high standards and I only want to work for a company that has the same values as me based on my research I genuinely believe I can build a long-term career here tip number three at the very start of your interview the hiring manager will say to you tell me about yourself now it is really important to know what you are going to say in response to this first interview questionif you can give a great answer to the tell me about yourself interview question is set you up with confidence for the rest of your interview conversely if you don't prepare anything and you end up giving a week answer it doesn't create a good first impression so when answering the first interview question Tell me about yourself my advice is to use the seat format to structure your response you can easily remember this because s stands forhe stands for the experience or educational qualifications you have a stands for any achievements you have gained in your life so far and he is the type of person you are and what you can bring to their company so let me know give you a quick example answer to that question tell me about yourself that uses a seat tell me about yourself here we go thank you for giving me this opportunity I alreadyturn off the skills and qualities to meet the expectations of the role I am a complete a finisher someone who can be relied upon to get a job done on time and to a great standard I am reliable flexible and adaptable and I will carry out tasks outside of my job description my educational qualifications are a good match for this role and I have experience working in teams and dealing with customers which means I can really hit the ground running I haveexcellent grades at College I was often praised in my last role for my speed of work and how I would get more work done than the average person if you hire me I will be the type of employee who will Embrace change positively be a great role model for the company and take ownership of my ongoing development so that's a great example answer to that first interview question Tell me about yourself that uses the easy to rememberlet me know give you 8 brilliant and powerful words to use in your interview that will impress the hiring manager it is essential you sell yourself in your job interview people are too afraid to beat themselves up but you have to do this in order to pass remember this is the first time the interviewer has ever met you they don't know you so you have to use powerful words and sentences to make yourself attractive as a potential employeeso take note of the following eight words and use these in your interview here we go number one is commercially driven this means you know that for their business or organization to succeed you must do a great job and help them grow number two is results orientated this means you always focus on achieving great things in your work number three is self-disciplined you can be left alone to organize your work and get things done on timeGoogle is enthusiastic this means you are energetic and passionate about what you do number five is complete to finisher this means you always finish things to the standards expected and you don't have to be reminded of what to do number 6 is Problem Solver you take ownership of difficult challenges and problems instead of Simply passing them on to your manager to deal with number seven is collaborator you work closely with other peopleseamlessly into any team and number 8 is industrious this is a really good one if you are industrious it means you are hardworking and determined so let me know give you three brilliant questions to ask at the end of your interview that will definitely boost your chances of getting hired now right at the very end of

"anything about working in machine learning is that every few years somebody invent something crazy that makes you totally reconsider what's possible like models that can play go or generate hyper-realistic faces and today the mind-blowing discovery that's rocking everyone's world is a type of neural network called a Transformer Transformers or models that can translate text write poems and ups and even generate computer code used in biology to solve the protein folding problem Transformers are like this magical machine learning that seems to makeTransformers so if you want to stay hip in machine learning and especially natural language processing you have to know about the Transformer so in this video I'm going to tell you about what Transformers are how they work and why they've been so impactful let's get to it so what is a Transformer it's a type of neural network architecture to recap neural networks are very effective type of model for analyzing complicatedplay data types like images videos audio and text but there are different types of neural networks optimized for different types of data like if you're analyzing images you typically use a convolutional neural network which is designed to vaguely mimic the way that the human brain processes vision and since around 2012 neural networks have been really good at solving Vision tasks like identifying objects in photos but for a long time we didn't have anything comparably good for analyzing language whether for translation or text summarization or text generation and this is a problemTransformers came around the way we use deep learning to understand text was with the type of model called a recurrent neural network or an RNN that looks something like this let's say you wanted to translate a sentence from English to French and r&n would take as input in English sentence and process the words one at a time and then sequentially spit out their French counterparts the key word here is sequential in language the order of words matters and you can't just shuffle them aroundfor example the sentence Jane went looking for trouble I mean something very different than the sentence trouble went looking for Jane So any model that's going to deal with language has to capture word order and recurrent neural networks do this by looking at one word at a time sequentially but our names had a lot of problems first they never really did well at handling large sequences of text like long paragraphs or essays by the time they were analyzing the end of a paragraph they'd forget what happened in the beginning and even worse are friends were pretty hard to train because they process2017 by researchers at Google on the University of Toronto and they were initially designed to do translation but unlike the current neural networks you could really efficiently paralyzed Transformers and that meant that with the right Hardwarepoetry and code and has conversations that was trained at almost 45 TB of text Data including like almost the entire public web so if you remember anything about Transformers let it be this way and the results will probably blow your mind so how do these things actually work from the diagram of the paper it should be pretty clear or maybe not actually it's something you might think there are three main innovations that make this model work sopositional and Coatings and attention and specifically a type of attention called self attention let's start by talking about the first one positional encodings let's say we're trying to translate text from English to French positioning is the idea that instead of looking at word sequentially you take each word in your sentence and before you feed it into the neural network you slap a number on it 1 2 3 depending on what number the word is in the sentence in other words you store information about word order in the data itself rather than in the structure of the networkhow to interpret those positional and Coatings in this way the neural network learns the importance of word order from the data this is a high-level way to understand positional encodings but it's Innovation that really helped make Transformers easier to train than RNs the next innovation in this paper is a concept called attention which you'll see used everywhere in machine learning these days in fact the title of the original Transformer paper is attention is all you need soagreement on the European economic area was signed in August 1992 did you know that that's the example sentence given the original paper and remember the original Transformer was designed for translation now imagine trying to translate that sentence to French one bad way to translate text is to try to translate each word one for one but in French translation European comes before economic plus French is a language that has gendered agreement between words so the word bien needs to bein the feminine form to match with Luzon the attention mechanism is a neural network structure that allows a text model to look at every single word in the original sentence when making a decision about how to translate a word in the output sentence in fact here's a nice visualization from that paper that shows what words in the input sentence the model is attending to when it makes predictions about a word for the output sentence so when the model outputs the word European it's looking at the input words European and economic you think of thisplurality and all of that grammatical stuff so we talked about two key Transformer Innovations positional and coating and attention but actually attention has been invented before this paper the real Innovation and Transformers was something called self attention a Twist on traditional attentionthe type of attention we just talked about how to do with aligning words in English and French which is really important for translation but what if you're just trying to understand the underlying meaning in language so you can build a network that can do any number of language tasks what's incredible about neural networks like Transformers is that as they analyze tons of text Data they begin to build up this internal representation or understanding of language automatically they might learn for example that the words programmer and software engineer andlearn the rules of grammar and gender and tens and so on the better this internal representation of language the neural network learns the better it will be at any language task and it turns out that attention can be a very effective way to get a neurological to understand language if it's turned on the input text itself let me give you an example take these two sentences can I have the check versus looks like I just crashed the server the word server here means toand I know that because I'm looking at the context of the surrounding words self-attention allows a neural network to understand a word in the context of the words around it so when a model processes the word server in the first sentence it might be attending to the word check which helps it disambiguate from a human server versus a metal one in the second sentence the model might be attending to the word crust to determine that the server is a machine self-attention can help neural networks disambiguate words recognize parts of speech and even identifyattention and self-attention of course this is a 10,000 ft look at Transformers but how are they actually useful what are the most popular Transformer based models is called Burt which was invented just around the time that I joined Google in 2018 but was trained on a massive Text corpus and has become a sort of General pocket knife for NLP that can be adapted to a bunch ofclassification and finding similar sentences it's used in Google search to help understand search queries and it Powers a lot of Google clouds and LP tools like Google Cloud auto mail natural language art also proved that you could build a very good models on unlabeled data like text from Wikipedia or Reddit this is called semi-supervised learning and it's a big Trend in machine learning right now so if you had how cool Transformers are youI want to start using them in your app no problem is a great place to grab pre-trained Transformer models like Earth you can download them for free in multiple language and drop them straight into your app you can also check out the popular at Transformers python Library built by the company hugging face that's one of the community's favorite

in 2 months people in 27 European countries will vote in elections to the EU Parliament it should be a celebration of European democracy but officials are concerned that Russia is attempting to influence the outcome of fears were aroused at the end of March when the check government shut down the news site called voice of Europe was being paid by Russia to spread propaganda and final cash to sympathetic lawmakers in the Europeanplay Parliament politicians from Germany France Poland Belgium the Netherlands and Hungary were allegedly given cash in exchange for making pro-russia remarks or today Belgium's prime minister Alexander de Cruz said his country had opened a formal investigation into the allegations he said Russian spy networks were operating in Belgium and several other European countries according to our intelligence service the objectives of Moscow are very clearthe objective is to help elect more progression candidates to the European Parliament and to reinforce a certain pro-russian narrative in that institution the goal is very clear a weekend European support for Ukraine serves Russia on the battlefield and that is the real name of what has been in covered in the last weeks even the International Center for defenseinsecurity in Estonian Capital Talent is an expert in Russian foreign and domestic policy or welcome to the day I guess we shouldn't be surprised that Russia is seeking to influence European elections Democratic processes around the world right now in Europe and North America are particularlymilitary assistance financial support and all kinds of political and diplomatic Aid European particularly important for Russia right now because it is the conduit to add to you for your crane so Russia intervening in the politics of Europe is meant to disrupt that supply of 8005because even if they change a couple of votes that's not going to that's not going to change the the way that the European Union as a block or indeed the United States as a as a block thinks of Ukraine is it you certainly the point is not so much more to continually continuouslyfrom the society's continuously undermine The credibility of the authorities in front of the broader population that's what this information does it's meant to create a skepticism divided Society exploits the divisions that already exists and with time eventually there will be a moment where there's a shift where our will to support Ukraine and will to defend ourselves and our will to stand up to Russiawhat's the long-term view that Russia has towards our societies and we've also seen this happening in the Czech Republic so should we presume that it's going on elsewhere across Europe as well definitely of finding divisions of disseminatinginformation on promoting their vision of their war of aggression against Ukraine and this is something that all European countries must look into to see how it affects them and how to cooperate with other partners and allies to precisely defend themselves and to protect themselves against this constant hybrid or and so the back dropped to to this of course is European parliamentary elections in June in which observers are expectingbe an increase in the number of right-wing and pro-russia candidates and parties certainly without thinking about specific parties with Russian disinformation strategic Communications is that is that Russia so it's message doesn't really have widespread purchaseSpectrum which happens to be very often in the far left or the far right and right now with the shifts in politics Russia's particular trying to capitalize on that right and so just to be clear is it illegal to pay European MEPS and is it illegal for them to receive paymentthis is something that there are many specific regulations I don't want to mislead the Audience by saying that it's definitely legal or illegal they're definitely are ethical questions when it comes to accepting payments for disseminating specific messages or not engaging in utilitiesdefinitely wants to be seen and start that said let's Russiacomprehensive and they don't have an intention to completely withdraw the European security order without crossing the threshold into outright War so how difficult does that make it calibrating a responsetraditional security and traditional defense they assume that there will be some sort of open hostility that the opponent will will make themselves be seen and be evident that they are fighting against you in this case it is all through some version it's more something of the Cold War although fought with new instruments in this case societal resilience andI'm going to the specifics but creating a society that is resilient in front of this information in front of active measures and this political Warfare it can also have an effect of deterrence and stopping Hospital actors from engaging in this type of activity when you give them as much to think about we thank you for that event from the International Center for defense and Security in time thank you so much thank you,Officials are concerned that Russia is attempting to influence the outcome of elections to the EU Parliament.

hey guys in this video let's talk about wedding is an important emotionally algorithm not only because it's what used in industrial applications but also because it's a winning solution for many machine learning competitions in this video will look at some interview questions related to grading busy and then we look at what is getting positive traits and finally we talked about action books okay let's start with look at some interview questions to give me a sense of whatwhat is grading boosting Masters describe the architecture of grading boosting which of the following are properties of addressing High variance in a grading boosting model increase the number of trees using one or two regularization using randomly selected sub samples none of the above what is action boost other watching this video you should be able to answer all this interview questions all right let's start withlearning about gradient Boston is also known as granny boosting machines for gbms is that Ensemble learning algorithm which is why they use in industrial applications and machine learning computations as I mentioned earlier it's also a supervised learning Amazon which attempts to accurately predict the Target by combining the estimates of a set of simpler and weaker Learners this week Learners learn sequentially and I was on converts many weeks into complexaccording to send procedure to minimize the loss when adding new Learners to The Ensemble here's a diagram showing how it works we start with a naive model or a simple model then we use this naive model to make predictions once we get the predictions we can calculate the laws on the loss function and then which a new model based on the laws we calculated from the previous prediction and then we add this new model to Ensemble we make predictions again so you can seesequential process and we keep adding new models to The Ensemble and the predictions will be improved okay now we have a basic idea of how grinding boosting Works let's look at gradient boosted trees growing boosted trees is a grandson when the weak learner is classification and the regression trees or card in the vuse the same tree is in iterative fashion using prediction residuals which is the difference between the Target and the predicting value in each iterationa new tree is fit on the residuals of the previous trip then the model improves as we are moving a tree more in the right direction while small Updates this updates are based on a loss gradients the training process iteratively adding new trees that predict the residuals of previous trees that are then combined with the previous trees to make the final prediction now let's look at Amazon in detail sometimes you might get interview questions about the architecture ofa tree with a single lymph node as the first model that's called f0x for each tree I from 1 to M where m is a pretty fine maximum number of trees or maximum number of iterations there are a few things we need to do with first computer are I of the tree and thenEnsemble and then we continue the next iteration to be the nutrients and finally we combined the predictions of all trees to Output the final prediction that's a general idea of how it works now let's look at each step in detail we first compute the residual RI RI is the next ingredients of the Lost function with respect to the prediction of the previousis a negative value of the partial derivative of the loss function l y f x with respect to FX which is a prediction of the previous tree for example if we are using mean squared error for the loss function then our last function l y f x in the sum of squares of the difference between why and FX what is the actual label and FX is a predictive value once we have the residual RI then we fit a new tree toall the features available to us the idea is that subsequent Learners are trying to predict hours of the previous prediction so our model will be improved because we keep correcting our previous mistakes unless I x r i - 1 is a function to predict Ri so this function is similar to the gradient of arai with respect to the prediction FX so if we're using the mean Square loss then the gradient of RIis precisely the residual the difference between Y and affects the next step is simply updated the prediction our new prediction in iteration I will be the prediction of the previous three plus Alpha by h i i is a learning rate typically a small value between 0.01 and 1 and here we scale h i buy Alpha to update the model incrementally by taking small steps which helps avoid overheating finally once we reach themaximum number of trees or the number of iterations the output fmx the overall prediction is given by a waiting sum of the collection so misunderstood steps of the Amazon if you can interview question about architecture of great and boosting or grading boosted trees then you should be able to draw this diagram and explain what happens in each iteration okay now let's move forward to the high performers of gradient boosted trees boosting reduce his bias and increases virus byprofessors overfeeding can be prevented here are the hyper hundreds we consume the first one is number of trees and the number of iterations increase the M reduces the error on the training set so it will reduce the bias but the setting too high to overheating maximum depth of trees is another Hypervenom we can do increase in the maximum depth will make the model more complicated and more likely to overfitdramatic improvements in models generalization ability but small ring rate means increasing communication of time both steering training and the prediction so there's a trigger we need to make when you find the optimal learning rate for our data set another hypermeter is a substance when the sample of fraction of the size of the training data prior to growing treesnormal values of a introduce reminisce into the algorithm and help prevent overfeeding now let's look at one of the interview questions we mentioned at the beginning of this video which of the following are appropriate methods of addressing High variance in a gradient boosting model the first one is increased the number of trees increasing the number of trees will not help prevent overheating in fact it will lead to overheating if the number is too high the second choice is to use a 1 or 2organization term especially adding penalized term to the loss function the next choice is to use randomly selected sub samples as I mentioned earlier when we select a sub sample from the training data will introduce Randomness to the algorithm and that will help prevent overheating so the second choice and the third choice will be the right answer to this question now let's summarize the pros and cons of getting boosted trees Garden busy treesit produces very accurate models and often in outperformed rainforest in accuracy there's no data pre-processing requires it often works well with categorical and the numerical values as is it can also handle missing data well imputation is not needed before we finish the data into the model there are also some downsize of running boosted trees growing boosting is a secret process that can be slow to turn its computationally expensivewhich can be time and memory exhaustive another downside of growing boosted trees is that in the sacrifices interpretability for accuracy is less interpretive in nature for example it is self-explanatory to follow the path that the decision tree takes to make predictions but the following the path of thousands of trees in grading both the trees is much harder so in terms of interpretability is not as good as decision treesplay Let's talk about extra boost what is actually boost attributes is short for extreme grading boosting its the most popular implementation of gradient boosting actually was also the winning solution for many Kegel competitions according to its documentation attributes is an optimized Distributing Library designed to be highly efficient flexible and portable the goal of this library is to push the extreme of the computationto provide a scalable portable and accurate Library actually was provides a parallel tree boosting that solves many different size problems in a fast and accurate way the same code runs a major distributed environment and cancel problems Beyond billions of examples so you know actually both is a library implementing the grinding boosting algorithm and is scalable portable and accurate as I mentioned earlier on the downside of getting boosting is that it'sseveral approximations and the tricks that can speed up the training process significantly there are some algorithm enhancements implemented in action books in the minimizes a rubberized objective function in the combines a Compact Plus function and the penalty term for model complexity which helps avoid overheating its efficient in terms of handling missing data which is simplifies the data preprocessing step it hasiteration which prevents the need to calculate the number of boosting iterations needed they are also system optimizations and has done in action books to increase the speed of training for example paralyzation in the uses paralyzed tree building the tree pruning process use steps first approach and improves the tree in the back road directions unlike the stop in criteria for Treeing used by Garden boosting machineswhich is greedy in nature and also has some Hardware organizations such as cash awareness and out of core Computing to increase the speed of training and prediction so these are the improvements at the board has done to make its scalable portable and ACC,In this video we look at some interview questions related to grading busy. We also look at what is getting positive traits and finally we talked about action books. In this video you should be able to answer all this interview questions all right.

today we're going to be talking about gradient boosting I know I'm excited about every single video I say I'm excited about every video but I'm very very excited about this one and the reason is because gradient boosting is this extremely flexible method in more ways than one we'll talk about all those ways but the other big thing is that gradient boosting is something that you often just use out of the box on the job so many of these other techniques you've learned like linear regression or logistic regression of course they're important to learntheir core their fundamental to data science going forward they form the foundation of many things but you're probably not going to be using a linear regression on the job by itself you're probably going to be using it in conjunction with other things but gradient boosting in my experience at least is one of these models or rather it's a family of models as we'll see which is something that there are industry level applications for right away so that's why it's pretty important to learn this once you've got this down I think you become a lot stronger of a statistician or a data scientist and so let's go ahead and get started we're going to starta real world situation as we always do let's say you have the Good Fortune of owning an ice cream shop and you're trying to build a model which is going to predict the number of ice cream cones you're going to sell on any given day and that there's some features out there let's say you're going to use temperature the day of the week there's some list of features you can use in your model and so in a little picture you're trying to take those features X and learn some kind of prediction function f of x which is hopefully going to tell you how many ice cream cones you sell on any given day let me pause here and talk about the first huge Pro of gradboosting which is that all they were clearly trying to solve a regression problem today it's some kind of continuous variable we're trying to predict grading boosting can solve yes regression problems also classification problems also more exotic things like ranking problems and other things as well so it's this kind of general purpose framework that is not just good for one type of problem it can really solve many many types of problems so that's one of the big flexibilities that has going for it and now let's talk about the first word ingredient boosting which is boosting ifyou haven't learned about boosting before it can be somewhat of an interesting weird concept so let me try to break it down before moving forward boosting says that when we learn this f of x so we're going to have some kind of final prediction function f of x model at the end of the day we're saying that boosting is saying that we're going to learn f of x as the sum of M weak Learners so mathematically it looks like this whatever function we learn at the end of the day is going to be able to be expressed as the sum of equals one to M of theis fee of x's Each of which is what we call a weak learner now a weak learner for example this is a regression problem you can think of a weak learners for example a underpowered linear regression or underpowered support Vector regression or any kind of regression model you've learned so far the only condition is that it should be underpowered it should not be too complicated and this this phrase is kind of more of an art than a science but basically means that you're not trying to kind of capture all the Dynamics in your datajust one of these weak Learners you're trying to capture some of them but the idea of boosting is that the next week learner that you train is going to learn from the mistakes of all the weak Learners that came before it so you train some really bad week learner first the next one learns from the mistakes of that won the one after that learns from the mistakes of the first two and so on and so on so that at the end of the day all the each of them is weak by itself when you combine them together you end up with something that's actually extremely powerful okay so that is the idea of boosting now let's go into theplay step by step process of gradient boosting and I'll make sure to explain the intuition and the interpretation along the way so let's start with Step Zero it's called Step Zero because it's not really part of the process but it is crucial something you have to decide on before starting which is Define your loss function so you need to decide some kind of lost function which inputs two things the true label in this case the true number of ice cream cones you sell on any given day and the other thing being the prediction why hat which is the output of your gradient boosted model so far and of course the higher thedysfunction is the worst job you're doing the higher loss you have and the lower the loss function is the better job you're doing now this last function needs to satisfy one other condition which is very important which is that it needs to be differentiable and and hopefully differentiable and efficient quick way this goes hand-in-hand with the fact this is called gradient boosting if we can't easily take gradients of our last function this is not as easy as if we can so we need to pick some kind of differential but lost function here and now we can start with the processstep one step one of the process is that we're going to start with some extremely weak learner F1 of X and for example we can just take the mean of all of the number of ice cream cones we sold in our training data and that can just be our first model clearly a terrible idea clearly a bad idea to just predict the mean for every single day but it's starting somewhere and not a kind of throw a picture in here if we plot the loss function so for example if you pick one observation in your training data I we can make a plot of the predictedvalue of this guy against the loss function which is the true value in predictive value being put in there and give us the loss function on the y-axis and for example let's say that the current prediction we have which is the average of all the wise is here so clearly we're not doing as good of a job as we could for this observation there's clearly many other values of this predicted value that could give us a lower loss and so that's kind of just saying we're not done yet but this picture is going to help us kind of understand what comes next speaking of what comes nextI'll spend some time on it we are going to compute these quantities are one I this one is basically just saying that we're currently looking at the first week learner this one's going to get updated as we move on this I is just the data point we're currently interested in so I was going to go from one to n if we have n data points so for each data point we're going to compute this derivative or this gradientdoes gradient is the derivative of the loss function which is the sky with respect to the prediction that we currently have right now and that's what this guy is saying here or saying that if we plug in the current prediction which is Big F1 of X which is exactly what you see here which is currently the mean of all the wise then this is going to give us the gradient now very mathematical so far let's look back at this picture to make sure we understand what this means graphically if I take the gradient of the Lostfunction for this current observation I at the place that the current prediction is that I'm basically getting this gradient right here that's more curvy than I would have liked but that's supposed to be a straight line gradient right there and another key thing is that we do the exact same thing for all data points I equals 1 to Big N so this is just the picture for one possible data point we have similar pictures of loss functions for all of our data points and we compute all of these gradients and those get stored in these are variablesnow why did we just do this we did this because we would like the next week learner that we learn to hopefully move this prediction in the direction of the decreasing loss so for example if I move this a little bit this way and I know to move it that way because the gradient I just completed is negative if my prediction was over here the gradient would have been positive and I know to move in the other direction so the gradient is informing which way am I supposed to go to minimize the loss on each of these different examples so if Iplay a little step in this direction that I'm going to be on my way to decreasing the loss on this particular example and also every example if I kind of generalize this process so that's the idea so now step 3 is that we fit that next week learner so here's where that next week learner comes in learning from the mistakes of the old we can learn so the way we fit this new week learner is we learn some kind of model a weak model where the target variable is our one hatwhich are all these gradients and the inputs are the same features we've always been using so the one thing that stays constant in this entire process is that each week Lerner is trained on the original set of features we were looking at the whole time and for example let's say our weekly and there's a linear regression then this F2 of X is going to be that week learner linear regression and now what we do is figure out how much in quotation marks how much of F2 to add to the current model which is just F1 of X and we dostop by solving this problem it looks complex but let's just kind of break it down what's going on this inner part is summing over I equals 1 to n which is every single data point we're just summoning the loss for every single data point the loss from putting in the True Value ye and putting in the proposed new prediction which is going to be the old model F1 of XI the old week Lerner plus I just snuck a little variable in their you probably notice but plus gamma so thatresume thing right there is the same variable gamma you're seeing here plus gamma times the new week learner so you can think of this as just some kind of recipe it's saying that I know that I'm going to add some quantity of this new week Lerner to my my model so far this is just saying how much do I want to add cuz I don't want to add too much I'm going to overshoot I don't want to add two little I'm going to undershoot so this is officially called a line search which looks for the correct gamma the correct amount of the new weak learner to add to the existing model so farwhich is going to minimize the sum across all lost functions for all and observations and the answer to that is going to be gamma to hat hey sorry to interrupt you pass Rich pick just realized while editing this video all of the math is correct here it might have been a better idea to put a negative sign in front of the gradient to make it match more like gradient descent and that way are gamers are always going to be positive the amount in which we travel in that direction and that's it we've done one iteration we've worked through all the math all thewhich is equal to the old weak learner which is this guy plus that amount of the new weak learner and this is going to do better this is going to do better than the old week Lerner alone because we have hopefully moved all of these predictions for all and observations in the direction for which their lost functions are a little bit lower than they were beforeand do this process all over again so let's talk to the high-level steps just so make sure you understand so next thing we're going to do is basically get these gradients again but now our prediction is going to be this the sum of 2 week Learners we're going to go ahead and fit a third week Lerner on those gradients using our features we're going to figure out how much of that we've learned to add to the existingand then we're going to say our updated model is equal to this guy plus gamma 3/2 * F3 of X and we just go on for as many iterations as we want just adding these weak Learners step by step by step and ladies and gentlemen that is radiant boosting now if you're like me you hopefully understand the process here but you might not be satisfied with why it works seems like everything we did was reasonable but why does this framework overall actually going to work in the end of the dayand so I think I do owe you that explanation and that's let's say the second to last thing we talked about today so why does this work well think about being a step and plus one in the process so you've trained M weak Learners so far so your current model looks like FM of X which is the sum of the M we can learn so far and now you've proposed some kind of new weak learner so you're going to add some quantity of this new week Lerner little FM plus one of X why is this doing a better job than FM of X by itselfthis form is approximately equal to the old week Lerner plus this amount plus r hat underscore M why because this new week Lerner FM + 1X was specifically trained to do a good job of predicting this RM hat so we can just put that right there putting this as an approximately equal to because it's trying to do as good of a job as possible being a weak learner but what is RM hat if we lookback at this form here RM hat is going to be this derivative of the loss function with respect to the current prediction which is FM of X and so in words what you're looking at is that the new model which is FM + 1 of X is going to be the previous model which is that guy plus a small step which is the smallest step here in the direction of the decreasing loss in the direction of thethis is just saying that we're going to take the previous model and walk a little bit in the direction where the loss is minimized for all these different data points and that hopefully is intuitive idea about why this works and why it's so powerful and I just want to recap how amazing this is I know this is a little bit of a longer video than usual but I think it deserves to be look at all the flexibility we have in this process the problem you can solve regression classification ranking whatever else you wantlogistic regression use decision trees use whatever you want there's so many points of flexibility such a catch-all framework that does really well in the real world this is something that you have to add to your tool belt in my opinion and now one note I'll say is that you typically hear about the weak Learners being decision treesMeridian boosted decision trees are kind of just a ubiquitous term in the industry and Academia now because we've seen in many many data sets many many different examples that if you're weak Learners are decision trees whether or not this is a classification regression ranking whatever problem this does really really really really really well and now the final thing I'll say before I let you all go is we've talked about all the amazing things but I have to talk about the drawbacks we have to talk about both sides the main two drawbacks here are first interpretabilityobviously we understand hopefully how it works but when you have this model at the end of the day which is the sum of all these weak Learners it can be pretty tough to understand or interpret how it actually works at the end of the day you can use these generic things like parcel dependence plots and sharply values but by itself understanding this intuitively is not the easiest thing in the world so we sacrifice some of that interpretability but get a lot of performance gains the other consideration is that it could be pretty computationally and efficient there's a lot of moving Parts heregradient boosted decision trees you can take various kinds of steps to make sure it's not overfitting you can keep the size of each decision tree we can learn or small maybe just like a couple of layers deep at Max you can limit the number of weak Learners that you have for example you can keep this m to something that's not massive so it's not going to overfit on the training data various steps likeit is definitely something to be concerned about but it's not even close to disqualifying this this framework is really cool so hopefully I convinced you of the power of gradient boosting or at least showed you how it works here if you like this video please like And subscribe for more videos just like this and I'll catch you next time," gradient boosting is something that you often just use out of the box on the job so many of these other techniques you've learned like linear regression or logistic regression. gradient boosting in my experience at least is one of these models or rather Gradboosting is a way to train a model to predict the number of ice cream cones you're going to sell on any given day. The first huge Pro of gradboosting which is that all they were clearly trying to solve boosting is a general purpose framework that is not just good for one type of problem it can really solve many many types of problems so that's one of the big flexibilities that has going for it. ion problems also classification problems also The idea of boosting is that the next week learner that you train is going to learn from the mistakes of all the weak Learners that came before it. At the end of the day all the each of them is weak by itself Step Zero is crucial something you have to decide on before starting. Define your loss function so you need to decide some kind of lost function which inputs two things. The true label in this case is the true number of ice cream cones step one of the process is that we're going to start with some extremely weak learner F1 of X. s called gradient boosting if we can't easily take gradients of our last function this is not as easy as if we This picture is going to help us kind of understand what comes next. We are going to compute these quantities are one I this one is basically just saying that we're currently looking at the first week learner this one's going to get The gradient of the Lostfunction for this current observation is that I'm basically getting this gradient right here that's more curvy than I would have liked but that's supposed to be a straight line gradient right there. Another key thing is Each week Lerner is trained on the original set of features we were looking at the whole time. The target variable is our one hatwhich are all these gradients and the inputs are the same features we've always been using so the one The inner part is summing over I equals 1 to n which is every single data point. The loss from putting in the True Value ye and putting in a proposed new prediction which is going to be the old model F1 of XI The line search looks for the correct gamma the correct amount of the new weak learner to add to the existing model so farwhich is going to minimize the sum across all lost functions for all and observations. The answer to that is going ""Radiant boosting"" is the process of adding weak Learners to a model. The goal is to make the Learners' lost functions a little bit lower than they were before. "" radiant boosting"" can be done by adding Lear Work overall actually going to work in the end of the dayand so I think I do owe you that explanation. Lerner FM + 1X was specifically trained to do a good job of predicting this RM hat so we can just put that This is a little bit of a longer video than usual but I think it deserves to be look at all the flexibility we have in this process the problem you can solve regression classification ranking whatever else you wantlogistic regression use decision trees use Meridian boosted decision trees are kind of just a ubiquitous term in the industry and Academia now.

Avatar the way of water is directed by James Cameron and arrives in theaters 13 years after destroying box office records back in 2009 Jake Sully lives with his Newfound family formed on the extrasolar moon Pandora but once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started Jake must work with naturi in the army of the navi race to protecthome I honestly thought that Avatar 2 would never come out I didn't even think it would ever happen it's been pushed back so far it's been delayed for so long and James Cameron is notoriously such a perfectionist and wants to invent new technology every time he touches the camera that I just assumed this movie would never happen and I'll admit to being disappointed that he had basically invested so much time of his life and his career into the Avatar Universe I like the first avatar I just watched it last nightI think it's a visually dazzling movie story-wise it's been done before just in different ways but of course it's undeniable that it was a technical achievement and it is a very entertaining fun crowd-pleasing movie but it's not my favorite James Cameron movie and I was hoping that he would lean more into something else nevertheless here we are with Avatar too it actually did happen and I remember when I heard the news article that he had already shot all of these sequences for the sequels even after this film and I was likeas long as he wants it's so crazy to even think about the fact that most films are restricted to a schedule like you can shoot your movie for 20 days or 25 days or 6 months or 3 months or 3 months or whatever James Cameron seems to just like wake up and just work on Avatar everyday forever but that's what happens when you've made the amount of great films that he has he is truly a master of his craft and if you ever actually have heard him talk about movies and the way he approaches filmbeing like with his master class course that I watched It's really inspiring to hear just how in-depth he thinks about every single thing from a technical perspective in his film and it's the best and worst part of both Avatar movies I really really enjoyed way of water I think it's just like the first technically mind-blowing it's absolutely staggering like very rarely do I leave a movie and go yeah II haven't got the first goddamn clue how they did that I know actors are in mocap suits but beyond that I got nothing it's without a doubt a real movie like bouldin in all capital letters this is like the type of film you just don't see that much and we've gotten now two of those this year between this and top gun Maverick it's insane the amount of visualIngenuity that is constantly on display I mean in the first avatar you kind of get bored sometimes during the sequences with human Jake Sully and you just kind of want to get them back to Pandora and all that cool stuff this movie is like only blue people from beginning to end its it's all blue people so I was in a constant state of awe from beginning to end I just don't know how this movie was made and it's it's mind-blowing just like the first one that I will say thatthe stories are very simple we've seen stories like this before and that seems to be the trick of the Avatar franchise thus far anyway you tell a very simple story that's appealing to anyone something like protect those you love and then you paint that story on a massive canvas of Otherworldly technology and places and things you've never seen before but the true trick of the Avatar franchise that James Cameron has pulled off thus far is that both the first film andfilm contain a very valuable message about our environment obviously the first one was about protecting our forests and this one is about protecting our oceans and if any young kids can go and watch this movie and experience that message and understand why that's important while also being entertained by people getting shot with bow and arrows a lot then that's good and that's what James Cameron is trying to do and that's very clear I mean evenwhen is real life he's done a lot of activism for the environment and so it's very important to him and so if you appreciate the planet we live on and hope to preserve it then Avatar 1 and 2 are going to have a deeper meaning for you and I'm going to feel more impactful but that really is the trick of all crowd-pleasing audience entertainment right big movies it's always simple stories told in a very big way I mean top gun Maverick is just a dressed up surrogate father son story right I mean that's what it is that it'sand it's great but there's also Jets and it's amazing and fun James Cameron is definitely tapped into the way to make these types of stories appealing they just require a lot of goddamn time and money to do it the way he wants to but just like the original avatar for the first half of this movie I didn't find myself emotionally engaged all that much you know you're learning the in your your feeling out the characters you're establishing a lot of different charactersand they are all in various different places in their lives and they're all going through different struggles and hardships and then right around the midpoint just like the original something devastating happens and you're like I'm fucking in all those people who just did that thing I want to see them pay that's the hook the first film gave me and that's the hook this one gave me too so the last half of both Avatar movies is just incredibleabsolutely thrilling the first half of both Avatar movies I didn't really find myself all that engaged now I'm talking purely about on an emotional level there is always something to engage with on the screen in Avatar 2 you can stare at the screen with your jaw hanging slack for this entire movie just wondering how it was done and if you see it in 3D like I did in fact I don't even know if there are 2D options maybe there are but the screening was in 3Dand I am not a fan of 3D and that is also a side effect of the first movie it made it so popular that all of a sudden all these films were post converting into 3D that were never supposed to be in 3D which I'm assuming pissed off a lot of filmmakers and every movie was in 3D forever but gratefully for me anyway that's kind of leveled out 3D has remained an option for at least a few showtimes a day for some of the bigger films but now with Avatar tubing in 3D it's not asimpressive to me because the first film and the response to it from Hollywood which is not Avatar or James Cameron's fault the response to it from Hollywood to make everything 3D for a few years made the experience of watching movies in 3D rather tiresome but there is no doubt in my mind that James Cameron has cracked the code for delivering the best possible 3D experience if you are forced or want to see this movie in 3D becauseit is beautiful it's very clear that James Cameron just doesn't accept something that doesn't look as real as it can and I think even sometimes then when something looks as real as it can he says well can that be better I will say there is an element of the film Beyond the fact that the emotional hook didn't really land for me until halfway through that just doesn't work at least in my opinion of course there's a young character in the filmthat is human who has sort of been left behind he's a product of things that occurred in the original film and he's sort of been adopted by the navi and his character is in the film a lot and it's not that he's like annoying or bothersome it's just that on the page or in this case on the screen I'm thinking about the screenplay I just didn't really understand his motivation he's very wishy-washyin a strange way he reminds me of the Mack character from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Ray Winstone is a fine actor is not an annoying character that you wish wasn't in the movie but you can't read him very well he keeps switching sides he'll do one thing for the good guys then you'll do one thing for the bad guys then I'll do one thing for the and you can't you can't read them and this kid his name is spider the character in the film I just I couldn't the motivation didn't feel clearto me and I wish that that storyline landed better because it includes some important elements similar to the first I think the thing that most people are going to be talking about is the final hour of the way of water because it is just non-stop I mean it's constant action drama suspense intention and Cameron does some very interesting things with the Dynamics of parents and their children and the roles they play and how one can help the other orand of course at the end of the day the thing that I think hopefully really going to stick with people is just that we need to protect our oceans and I really admire Cameron for using this broad audience entertainment to hopefully convey a deeper message that could potentially enact people to take some things seriously that maybe they weren't thinking about before odds are if you like movies you're probably going to go check out Avatar the way of water in theaters but I do encourage you to because anytime a big movie comes out in theaters I'm glad to seeyou're supported and even though this is technically a massive IP it is an original thing that Cameron just kind of invented and it's this world that's supported by two films and over a decade of work so you know you can spend a few hours and go see it guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to
