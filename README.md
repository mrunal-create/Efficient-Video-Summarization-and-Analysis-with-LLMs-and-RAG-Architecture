# Efficient Video Summarization and Analysis with LLMs and RAG Architecture

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop an efficient video summarization system using cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, T5, and BART, along with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The system will automatically extract key information from videos, providing users with concise summaries and facilitating easy access to relevant content.

**Running the App:**
1) Clone the repo into your local machine.
2) Add all the files in the App folder to the respective python project.
3) Run the App by using the command 'Streamlit run App.py'

**Disclaimer**
This project makes use of certain gated Hugging Face models and the OpenAI clip model. Inorder to run this project, you need to get these free/paid key and add them in the Globals.py file.
